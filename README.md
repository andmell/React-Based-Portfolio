# React Based Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio was built using React as a templating engine, with Tailwind as a CSS framework. I wanted to re-create my portfolio using React to showcase my styling and templating abilities. On top of that, it provides me a site to showcase my work to those who are interested. 
## Usage
Feel free to visit the site deployed on Netlify [here](https://main--classy-dragon-e9a5cd.netlify.app/).
